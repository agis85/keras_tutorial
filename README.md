# Python Demo for [Keras]

The demo contains 2 scripts for classification and segmentation using the Keras Neural Network library.

The assumed data input shape is (channels, height, width). Keras by default is configured to expect (height, width, channels).
To change this, edit ~/.keras/keras.json file and set parameter "image_data_format": "channels_first"
